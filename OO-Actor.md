 * Message used by the producer for continuously polling the
 * data-source, while in the polling state.
 */
case object PollTick

 * State machine with 2 states:
 *
 *  - Standby, which means there probably is a pending queue of items waiting to
 *    be sent downstream, but the actor is waiting for demand to be signaled
 *
 *  - Polling, which means that there is demand from downstream, but the
 *    actor is waiting for items to happen
 *
 * IMPORTANT: as a matter of protocol, this actor must not receive multiple
 *            Continue events - downstream Router should wait for an item
 *            to be delivered before sending the next Continue event to this
 *            actor.
